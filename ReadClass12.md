## Accessing Data with JPA
### How are query methods defined when using Spring Data JPA?


Query methods in Spring Data JPA are defined by creating methods in a repository interface that follow a specific naming convention. Spring Data JPA derives queries from method names. For example, a method named findByLastName(String lastName) in a repository interface will automatically generate a query to retrieve records based on the last name attribute.


### Which dependencies will you need in order to complete the Spring guide?


Java 17 or later.
Gradle 7.5+ or Maven 3.5+ for building the project.
Spring Data JPA and H2 Database dependencies. These can be added to your project using Gradle or Maven. In the example, H2 Database is used for a memory-based database.
What annotations are used to specify an auto-generated identification number for an Entity?
@Id: This annotation is used to mark a field as the primary key of the entity.
@GeneratedValue: This annotation is used to specify how the ID is generated. In this case, it is set to GenerationType.AUTO, which means that the ID will be automatically generated by the underlying database system
Comparing repositories

### Which of the Spring Data Repositories covered in the readings has the most methods available to it?


The JpaRepository has the most methods available among the Spring Data Repositories discussed in the readings. It extends both PagingAndSortingRepository and CrudRepository, which means it includes all the methods provided by both of these interfaces in addition to its own methods.
Name a downside of a Spring Data Repository.
One downside of using a Spring Data Repository is that it can lead to tight coupling between your code and the Spring Data library. This means your code becomes dependent on the specific abstractions and methods provided by Spring Data, such as Page or Pageable. While this may not be an issue in many cases, it can limit flexibility and make it challenging to expose fine-grained control over the methods exposed by the repository.


### How would you define an operation to find a student based on their name in a repo named StudentRepository which extends JpaRepository?


To define an operation to find a student based on their name in a repository named StudentRepository, which extends JpaRepository, you can simply declare a method with a specific naming convention. In this case, you would create a method with a name like findByName(String name) in the StudentRepository interface. Spring Data JPA will automatically generate the query for you based on the method name, and it will return the Student entity with the matching name.
 public interface StudentRepository extends JpaRepository<Student, Long> {
    Student findByName(String name);
}
