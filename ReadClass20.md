## What is an Intent in Android Studios? Give some fresh examples of when you might use it.

An intent is a basic building block of Android programming that enables communication within an Android application and across other apps running on the device. Usually used to initiate a service, transmit a message, or begin another activity, it signifies the intention to carry out an action.

There are two kind of intent:

- Explicit Intent: Used to start a specific component within the same application.
- Implicit Intent: Used to request an action from another component of the system or a different application.

## Describe an Activity in your own word.

An Activity can be thought of as a page in a book. Each page (Activity) in the book has its own function and content, and the user turns the pages to travel through the app.
