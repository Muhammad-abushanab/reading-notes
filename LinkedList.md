## LinkedList
linkedlist it's valuable when you need to dynamically store a collection of elements that can be efficiently inserted, deleted, or traversed. Linked lists consist of nodes, each containing data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows you to create flexible data structures that adapt to changing requirements.

## component of linkedlist:

- Node
- Tail
- Head
## Advantages of Linked Lists

- Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow or shrink as needed. You don't need to specify a fixed size at the beginning.

- Memory Allocation: Linked lists allow efficient memory allocation. Elements don't need to be stored in contiguous memory locations, unlike arrays.

## Types of Linked Lists :

- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List


### Why Linked Arrays: 
Linked arrays are employed when the number of elements is uncertain or could change dynamically. They offer efficient solutions for adding and removing elements.

### What Linked Arrays Are: 
Linked arrays consist of individual elements that store data and pointers to the subsequent elements. These pointers create a sequence of connected elements.

### How Linked Arrays Work: 
To construct a linked array, each element is designed with data and a reference pointing to the next element. These connections establish a chain that allows easy traversal, addition, or removal.

```java
class LinkedList {
Node head; // head of list
/*Linked list Node*/
class Node {
int data;
Node next;
// Constructor to create a new node
// Next is by default initialized
// as null
Node(int d) { data = d; }
}
}
```
