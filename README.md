## Overview:

Welcome to the **Reading Notes** repository, your personal hub for tracking and sharing your journey of continuous learning in the field of software development. This repository serves as a curated collection of your insights, key takeaways, and progress as you delve into various topics and resources related to software engineering.

## Prep-course:

- ### Front-end Development Progress:

  During the preparation course, I have covered essential front-end technologies, honing my skills in creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces. The front-end part included the following:

  - **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** I delved into the fundamental trio of web development—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—to structure web content, apply styles, and implement dynamic behaviors.

  - **React.js:** I gained hands-on experience with React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building reusable user interface components and front-end applications.

- ### Backend Development Progress:

  In the backend part of the course, I focused on building robust and scalable server-side applications. I learned the following technologies:

  - **Node.js:** I became proficient in Node.js, an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, enabling me to develop server-side applications with ease.

  - **PostgreSQL:** I explored PostgreSQL, a powerful and open-source relational database, to manage and store data securely and efficiently.

  - **Express.js:** I gained practical experience with Express.js, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, to create RESTful APIs and handle server-side routes effectively.
