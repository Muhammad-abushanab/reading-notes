## What are the benefits of the Amazon Polly service?

Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech, essentially giving a voice to written content. In simpler terms, it's like having a digital assistant that can read out loud written text in a natural-sounding way.

## What are the benefits of the Amazon Polly service?

- **High quality** – Amazon Polly offers both new neural TTS and best-in-class standard TTS technology to synthesize the superior natural speech with high pronunciation accuracy (including abbreviations, acronym expansions, date/time interpretations, and homograph disambiguation).

- **Low latency** – Amazon Polly ensures fast responses, which make it a viable option for low-latency use cases such as dialog systems.

- **Cost-effective** – Amazon Polly's pay-per-use model means there are no setup costs. You can start small and scale up as your application grows.

- **Cloud-based solution** – On-device TTS solutions require significant computing resources, notably CPU power, RAM, and disk space. These can result in higher development costs and higher power consumption on devices such as tablets, smart phones, and so on. In contrast, TTS conversion done in the AWS Cloud dramatically reduces local resource requirements. This enables support of all the available languages and voices at the best possible quality. Moreover, speech improvements are instantly available to all end-users and do not require additional updates for devices.
