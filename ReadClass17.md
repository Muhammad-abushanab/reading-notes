## In non-technical terms, describe what using OAuth can provide for your application

Imagine you want to log in to a new app using your Google or Facebook account. OAuth enables this by allowing the app to ask Google or Facebook to vouch for your identity. If you're already logged into Google or Facebook, you don't need to enter your credentials again. The app receives a token, like a stamp from your trusted friend, confirming who you are. This token is then used to access the app.

Github : Integration with GitHub allows users to log in using their GitHub accounts.
