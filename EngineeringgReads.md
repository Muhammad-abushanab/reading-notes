# What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

My ability and persistence in growing myself and learning anything new that will help me become a better person.

## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

1. Break down my difficulty into smaller bits.
2. Attempt to fix it in a different manner.
3. Look for a comparable but not identical answer.
