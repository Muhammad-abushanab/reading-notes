## Explain to a non-technical friend the concept of inheritance in Java ?

it's like child and parent when some married couples give a birth of a child this child may has some of the properties from his parents. this also in java when you extend a class from the parent you have access to the properties in the parent calss.

## Static methods are also called what? Why?

Static methods are also called "class methods" because they belong to the class itself rather than to instances (objects) of the class.

## What is a Design Pattern? Describe one or two with analogies from your previous work experience.

A design pattern is a reusable and general solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.

The Facade design pattern is like a simplified front-facing interface that hides the complexity of a system behind it. It provides a unified and easy-to-use interface for a set of more complex and interconnected subsystems. This pattern aims to make the interactions with a system simpler by abstracting away the intricate details of its components.

## What is a Singleton?

Imagine you're in charge of managing a super-secret headquarters with a single control room. Only one person should have access to that control room at a time to avoid confusion and conflicts. In software design, the Singleton pattern is similar. It ensures that a class has only one instance throughout the program's lifetime. This can be useful when you want to centralize control of a specific resource, like a database connection or a configuration manager.
