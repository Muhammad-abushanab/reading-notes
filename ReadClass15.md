# Trees

Trees are non-linear data structures that represent nodes connected by edges. Each tree consists of a root node as the Parent node, and the left node and right node as Child nodes.

## Why Trees Matter

Trees provide an organized and hierarchical way to store and represent data. They are particularly useful in scenarios where data has a natural hierarchical structure, such as file systems, organization charts, or family trees. By understanding trees, I can gain insights into efficient data organization, searching, and manipulation techniques that can be applied to solve real-world problems.

## Binary tree

A tree whose elements have at most two children is called a binary tree. Each element in a binary tree can have only two children. A node’s left child must have a value less than its parent’s value, and the node’s right child must have a value greater than its parent value.

## Example

        10
       /  \
      5    15
     / \     \
    3   7     20
In this binary tree:

The top node with the value 10 is called the root.
The node with the value 5 is the left child of the root.
The node with the value 15 is the right child of the root.
The node with the value 3 is the left child of the node with value 5.
The node with the value 7 is the right child of the node with value 5.
The node with the value 20 is the right child of the node with value 15.
