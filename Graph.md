# Analogy

- **Vertex/Node:** Each city is a point on a map.
  
- **Edge:** The roads or highways between cities represent connections.

- **Neighbor:** Cities directly connected by roads are neighbors.

- **Degree:** How many cities are directly reachable from a particular city.

- **Directed vs. Undirected:** If roads between cities are two-way, it's like an undirected map. If roads have a specific direction, like one-way streets, it's directed.

- **Complete vs. Connected vs. Disconnected:** Complete if every city is reachable from any other, connected if there's a path to reach any city, disconnected if some cities are isolated without any roads connecting them.

- **Acyclic vs. Cyclic:** Acyclic if you can't take a route that leads you back to the same city without retracing any roads, cyclic if there's a loop in the roads.

- **Graph Representation:** Showing cities and their connections on a map or in a list (which cities connect to which).

- **Weighted Graphs:** If roads have different speed limits or distances between cities, reflecting varied importance or lengths of routes.

- **Traversals:** Navigating the map systematically, either by following interstates (like moving between major cities) or exploring specific regions (like tracing historical routes).

- **Real World Uses:** Similar to understanding a map for planning travel routes, understanding graphs helps in navigating networks, suggesting connections, or optimizing travel plans.

**Why:**
- *Connectivity:* Visualize a map to better understand connections and routes.

**What:**
- *Vertex/Node:* Cities represented as points.
- *Edge:* Roads representing connections between cities.
- *Neighbor:* Directly connected cities.
- *Degree:* Number of cities directly reachable from a particular city.

**How:**
- *Directed vs. Undirected:* Two-way roads (undirected), one-way roads (directed).
- *Complete vs. Connected vs. Disconnected:* All connected, some links, or isolated regions.
- *Acyclic vs. Cyclic:* No loops or loops in road networks.
- *Graph Representation:* Map or list indicating city connections.
- *Weighted Graphs:* Reflecting different distances or importance of roads.
- *Traversals:* Navigating a map systematically.
- *Real World Uses:* Simplifies planning travel routes, suggesting shortcuts, or optimizing travel plans.
