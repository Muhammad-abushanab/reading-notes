1. **What makes an API RESTful?**
   
   An API (Application Programming Interface) is considered RESTful (Representational State Transfer) when it adheres to the architectural principles and constraints of REST. These principles include:

   - **Statelessness**: Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server should not store any client state. This allows for scalability and easy recovery from errors.

   - **Client-Server Architecture**: Separation of concerns between client and server. Clients are responsible for the user interface and user experience, while servers are responsible for handling requests and business logic.

   - **Uniform Interface**: REST APIs use a consistent and uniform interface for interactions, including resources (URLs), HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), status codes, and representations (usually in JSON or XML).

   - **Resource-Based**: Resources (e.g., data entities) are identified by URLs and can be manipulated using standard HTTP methods.

   - **Stateless Communication**: Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store information about the client's state.

   - **Representation**: Resources can have multiple representations (e.g., JSON, XML, HTML), and clients can choose the one they prefer.

   - **Stateless Communication**: The client and server communicate without the server maintaining any information about the client's state between requests. Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.

2. **What is the benefit of using GraphQL? Any downsides?**
   
   GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need and nothing more. The benefits of using GraphQL include:

   - **Efficiency**: Clients can request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data, which is common in REST APIs.

   - **Flexibility**: Clients can ask for data in a single request, reducing the number of round trips to the server. This is particularly valuable for mobile applications.

   - **Strongly Typed**: GraphQL is strongly typed and provides a clear schema, making it easier for clients and servers to understand data structures and types.

   - **Versioning**: Avoids the need for API versioning since clients can evolve their queries as needed.

   However, there are some downsides to GraphQL:

   - **Learning Curve**: Developers may need to learn a new query language and understand the complexities of schema design.

   - **Security**: Improperly configured GraphQL endpoints can lead to security vulnerabilities like request depth attacks or denial of service.

   - **Complex Queries**: Clients can construct complex queries, potentially putting more load on the server if not optimized.

3. **Describe "serverless" to a new 301 Code Fellows student.**
   
   "Serverless" does not mean there are no servers; it means that as a developer, you don't have to manage the servers yourself. Instead, cloud service providers (like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions) handle server management for you. Key points about serverless:

   - **Event-Driven**: Serverless applications are typically event-driven, responding to events like HTTP requests, database changes, or file uploads.

   - **Scaling**: Serverless platforms automatically handle scaling, so your application can handle many requests without manual intervention.

   - **Billing**: You're billed only for the compute resources used during the execution of your functions. If there's no traffic, there are no charges.

   - **Microservices**: Serverless is often used for building microservices, where each function performs a specific task.

   - **Stateless**: Serverless functions are stateless, meaning they don't retain information between executions. Data persistence is typically handled by external services like databases or storage.

   - **Rapid Deployment**: You can deploy and update serverless functions quickly, without worrying about server provisioning or infrastructure management.

   Serverless is a valuable paradigm for building scalable and cost-effective applications, and it's commonly used in combination with other cloud services to create flexible and efficient systems.
