**Analogies:**
Imagine a stack of plates in a cafeteria or a queue of people waiting in line. These real-world scenarios can help you understand the concepts of stacks and queues in computer science.

**Definition:**

- **Stack:** A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Think of it as a stack of books, where the last book you place on the stack is the first one you'll remove.
- **Queue:** A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It's similar to people waiting in a line â€“ the person who enters first is the one who gets served first.

**Why Stacks and Queues:**
Stacks and queues are used to manage data in various algorithms and applications. They help in organizing and processing data efficiently.

**How Stacks Work:**

- **Push:** To add an item to a stack, you "push" it onto the top. The item becomes the new top.
- **Pop:** To remove an item from a stack, you "pop" the top item. The item just below the top becomes the new top.

**How Queues Work:**

- **Enqueue:** To add an item to a queue, you "enqueue" it at the end. The item becomes the last in line.
- **Dequeue:** To remove an item from a queue, you "dequeue" the front item. The item just behind the front becomes the new front.
